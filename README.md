# ETCH-A-SKETCH-PAD

A Etch-a-Sketch and Sketchpad hybrid project from The Odin Project

What I learned:

A bit on how the grid property works in css
A LOT on how events work and how to setup mouse dragging coloring
Learned how to disable the "Drag" of the gird itself
How to add in a slider for input and grab the value
How to use a function to create user inputed elements

Things I want to improve:

I would like to work on @media queries to make it more mobile friendly
Would also then need to figure out how to take touch input to draw on grid
Maybe come back and spruce up the css, but I like that it looks clean
